# Shine Ultimate Webapp Wiki

This is the wiki for the Shine Ultimate Webapp. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as the project progresses.

**What is the Shine Ultimate Webapp?**

The Shine Ultimate Webapp is a web application that allows users to manage the presences of their parkour courses.
It is a project that I am working on in my spare time, and is a way for me to learn more about web development.

**What is the current status of the project?**

The project is currently in the early stages of development. The current version of the webapp is a prototype, and is
not intended for public use. The current version of the webapp is
available  [here](https://github.com/Freskies/ShineUltimateWebApp/).

**What is the current roadmap for the project?**

The current roadmap for the project is as follows:

- [x] Create a prototype of the webapp
- [ ] Create a database to store the data
- [x] Create a login system
- [ ] Create a system to add, remove and modify courses
- [ ] Create a system to add, remove and modify presences
- [ ] Create a system to add, remove and modify users
- [ ] Create a system to add, remove and modify admins
- [ ] Create graphics for the webapp (principally for phones)
- [ ] Host the webapp and the database on a server

**How can I use the webapp?**

This webapp is designed to be used by Shine asd, but it can be used by anyone. If you would like to use the webapp, you
can contact the developer to get access to the webapp. Probably it works well for every parkour club!
